## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (SCSS)
- CSS custom properties (SCSS Variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility features
- Google fonts
- CSS Resets
- Custom Button Styles

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I improved my skills in Semantic HTML5, SCSS, and responsive design using a mobile-first workflow. I practiced Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries to create adaptive layouts while enhancing accessibility with proper `aria-labels` and interactive button styles. This project strengthened my ability to write clean, modular code.

### Continued development

For continued development, I plan to enhance user experience with CSS animations, improve accessibility with better focus states and contrast, and optimize performance through font preloading and image compression. I also aim to explore responsive typography with CSS clamp() and apply these skills to dynamic projects using React.
